Casual project for me to learn the ropes of Unity by re-creating a game that I'm familiar with (Pokemon).

Features implemented:
-3D tile-based player movement (8 directions)
-Pokemon Battle System
--Player move selection
--Battle item usage (including Poke Balls to catch wild pokemon)
--Party screen & pokemon switching
--Enemy "AI" (random move selection currently)
--Stat changes
--Non-volatile status effects
--Damage Calculation from the main game
---Type advantages
---Move Power
---Pokemon stats (user's Atk/SpA and target's Def/SpD) based on move category (physical/special)
---Weather effects
---Random factor
-Tall grass that initiates wild battles
-Pokemon leveling and evolution
-NPCs
--Random and scripted movement
--Dialog, quests, and gift items/pokemon
--Trainer battles
--Party healing


*I'm a programmer at heart, so my main focus was the game engine not the graphics, plus I was experimenting with both 2D tilesets/sprites and 3D Models as I learned, so the visuals are obviously all placeholders at the moment to let me test the engine*
